I order 20lb bags to be sure they stay fresh and receiving my order this way was very unprofessional to me, especially at the premium price charged.

The two things I noticed that may pose an issue of stopping this product from being five star are: (1) the syrcingle straps are much too long, even with adjustment on my 78 inch blanket to leave on my mare unattended.  My mare is not underweight  and she is a stock breed but the straps are long enough for a much bigger girth and belly. She usually wears a 76 or 78 inch blanket so I chose 78 to purchase instead of a 75. Maybe those straps would have fit her better but the blanket might be short or tight in the shoulders.(2) The hardware on the front closure and straps seem a bit lightweight compared to my barn blankets. I hope they don't bend out of shape Overall I am very happy with the performance and look of this product and look forward to the beneficial physical therapy it brings",

It was purchased through an online dealer on Dec 4, 2018, and I received a week or 2 later. After the season was over, I had the blanket professionally cleaned and the blanket came back wrapped so I just put it in storage. I pulled it out last night (December 17th) as it was the first night we had freezing temps this winter. I noticed that there was loose wadded material inside the blanket around the bottom. The cleaning company said they cleaned it according to manufacturer instructions. I called customer support and since it has been over 1 year since the purchase date by 2 weeks, they said there is nothing that could be done. The blanket worked great last winter, but I am very disappointed with how it held up.",

        "consumer_review": "Recently, I purchased the new Back On Track Padded Hock Pads and Knee Pads.  Together it was an expensive investment but, worth it to help my mare's arthritis.  Neither the knee pads nor the padded hock pads stay up. They slide down around the horses hooves.  I went back to the Back On Track website and found the following statement, \"When using these boots it helps to use standing wraps to prevent them from sliding down.\"This required an additional purchase of standing wraps.    I now have a $200.00 investment for knee pads, hock pads and standing wraps.   Another option would be to purchase Royal Quick Wraps which is Back On Tracks version of Standing Pad for $93, escalating the cost even more.  I called the company and expressed my displeasure at  a product that does not stay up without purchase an additional product.  I felt if it was a known issue by Back on Track that the knee and padded hock pads won't stay up, standing wraps should be included with the product by Back On Track.  When the pads slip they become a tripping hazard for the horse.  In addition, if the horse is stalled it becomes nervous as it does not like the pads around the hooves, increasing the risk of injury.   In addition, it takes more time than just slipping on a couple of pads.  Applying the standing wraps at night and taking them off in the morning adds much more time.  I called Back On Track's customer support.  The customer support representative listened and was polite but, and I got the typical I understand speech but, they didn't offer to do anything.    It was a \"sorry, that's just the way it is\" attitude.",

He was still a puppy (9 months) with a few behaviour issues to work out, so we wanted to make sure we found just the right home for him where patience and love ruled (we could no longer keep him ourselves b/c of very serious asthma issues my husband was experiencing).I corresponded with a lot of different people through the site and we ended up with a lovely family that really seemed like the perfect match. We have been in touch with them and the dog is doing very well! My anxieties over the dog's future have dissipated, and I feel so fortunate that your website facilitated that.

I asked for quotes on qty 25 and 100 for 2G and 4G drives. I got an email from \"Esther\" who also signed her name \"Kristine\", but it was only for 100 units. I wrote back and told Esther/Kristine that it was a bit more than I was able to spend, could she please send the quote for 25 units. Instead of sending me the quote, she asked me what my budget was. I told her what I'd LIKE to spend and she said they couldn't do that. She still didn't send the quote for 25. And the letter continued with reasons why they were more expensive, but the writing wasn't even correct English so I feel like the entire thing is suspect.",

        "consumer_review": "I called regarding an issue with the usb ports on my computer suddenly not working. I panicked and instead of looking for solutions on youtube like I normally would, I tried calling this company which has good reviews.  I was offered tech support at a one-time rate of $69.99, and asked what would be paying for exactly.  I was told that the tech would help me solve my issue \"permanently\". This is the first time I've had an issue with my computer in the near 6 years I've owned it, and it was the result of a windows update which effected many people as far as I've read. The tech called me, his name was Robert, and he was very short and seemed irritated. He had me restart my computer and repeatedly press the F2 key on the keyboard to bring up the reset to factory settings prompt.  He told me to reset my computer which I did, and that he would call me back when it was completed.  There was no return phone call that day, and I went through the rest of the process of bringing my computer back up to speed on my own.  I wasn't contacted again until the next day while I was at work, and the representative seemed confused that I wasn't sitting in front of my computer still a day later.  Robert contacted me again an hour after this call and wanted to know when to call back. I work 10 plus hours a day so I couldn't give him a firm time when I'd be home and asked for a number to contact them so I could get this permanent fix to my issue. He was very rude and wanted to get off the phone as quickly as possible. He asked if they resolved my issue, which yeah the usb is working again, but they didn't do what they said they would do and fix anything permanently. He laughed and asked again if they resolved the issue.  I'm at work while this conversation is happening so it was very irritating to me. I would never call Support Nerds again. $69.99 to tell me to press F2 when I found a video on youtube which could have done the same thing for free.  There was no follow up, nor a permanent fix to the original issue. I was offered a free upgrade to windows 10, which is great because it's free anyways but no thanks. Try youtube first before you hand over your hard earned money to these rude people.",

My dealer refused to work with them due to the time involved in trying to get claims processed. Additionally, I didn't find this out until I had already had the coverage for 6 months and spent $450. That money was refused to be refunded to me on the grounds that they didn't break the contract in their eyes. When asked for a list of providers local to me they gave me one. The one they provided wasn't an acceptable option for me. Bottom line is that if you don't verify first that your mechanic will honor this warranty you can expect to go through a hassle at a minimum, and lose money in the process. I will add that I checked with both local Jeep dealers, as well as an independent mechanic that a friend of mine uses and not only did they say they wouldn't work with this insurance but they gave the reason that it's too much a hassle to get claims processed through this carrier.",

Operating the brake on three out of four casters I received was very difficult - one was basically frozen in place.

That part did take an extra week but quality was at the top of my list so I did not mind.  I was hoping my shipment would arrive by Thanksgiving and it did with two days to spare.  The quality of my photography shines through with the quality of the printing.  The problems my order incurred were during packaging and shipping where each of the two pallets broke along the way resulting in 2 of the 1000 books being destroyed by a forklift operator (stronger pallets would be better).  Also, I ordered a wrap around glossy photo for my cover and 50% of the books incurred a mark (probably from a conveyer) in the form of a line that runs across either the front or back of the covers and it is permanent.  This happened some time before or while the finished books were packaged.  This lowers the quality of half of my books before they are ever opened.  I'm still hoping PrintNinja will compensate me for this issue.",

After the first section (about 3 hours\u2019 time) the course said I was 10% through, so I was super excited that things were going smoothly (keep in mind the course says it takes 30 hours to complete). However, after working through the next sections for the same amount of time and only completing another 3-5% of the course, I was becoming suspicious. My suspicions were confirmed that this course takes more than 30 hours over the next 20-ish sections; in fact, when I finished the course, my time totaled to over 50 hours - and that is with me advancing as fast as I can on each slide. So, if you are willing to give more of your time to learning the laws of the road, then this is a great course for you. But, if you were just looking to complete the assigned number of hours by Joshua\u2019s Law (30 hours), then I recommend you send your business elsewhere.",

The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 was for this very reason, I paid a lot of money with the belief that she would improve her score and she didn\u2019t. So I did not get what I paid for.

        "consumer_review": "I used the online tutoring service offered by Varsity Tutors for MCAT Prep. During the course of about 2.5 months, I went through 4 tutors. Based off my experience, I believe Varsity Tutors should have a different screening process for their tutors. According to my account manager, the main criteria for their tutors included achieving a high MCAT score and possibly being accepted into a prestigious medical school. However, it is my understanding that ability to teach was not taken into account during the hiring process.       My first tutor seemed knowledgable, but very distracted. I was not convinced he was invested in my learning process. When we would have sessions, he would often be talking to people in the background, excusing himself multiple times, and ending our sessions early.       My second tutor was highly knowledgable and accomplished. However, he seemed overloaded with his residency program and tutoring responsibilities. He would often not respond to my messages and scheduling new sessions was very difficult. Ultimately, I felt he was not able to invest in me the appropriate amount of time.      My third tutor did not convince me that he was sufficiently knowledgable about the material. He seemed disorganized and uninterested. There was an instance where I was having a hard time during a practice test and was feeling overwhelmed. After telling him this, he told me to consider pulling my med. school app and taking the test the following cycle. While I believe he was trying to be realistic with me, he did not ask, \"What is it that you're struggling with? Let's go over it\". Instead, he made a rash suggestion without first investigating the situation. This is an attribute I don't think is appropriate for a tutor, much less a physician.       My last tutor was EXCELLENT. She was prompt, communicative, organized, and highly invested in my experience. She offered me SO much advice regarding the medical school application process and I ended up also seeking her help in writing my Personal Statement. She is the reason I give this company one of the stars. She was extremely knowledgable and methodical in her approach, she knew how to teach, and she was an overall excellent tutor.      Varsity Tutors ended up giving us a partial refund, which is the reason I awarded a second star. Ultimately, I believe this company has potential, but needs to look at their screening process for tutors. If they are going to charge high rates for tutoring services, the tutors should be excellent.",

        "consumer_review": "I opened a \"ProFinder\" professional services request via LinkedIn and Resume Spice was one of the respondents.  The person I was contacted by was eloquent and had a fantastic back ground (Harvard MBA, been offering resume consulting services for 2 years, headhunter for 5 years).  I was intrigued so had the consult (where I would get to interview the service).  However, the person I interviewed was not the person who contacted me about the service.  Strange, but she was well spoken, had some great ideas and feedback about my existing resume, so I signed up.  When it came time for someone to write my resume, it was yet another person (so, not the person with the impressive background that approached me, and not the person I interviewed).  The person who ended up providing the service had only been with the firm for less than two months; I would not have hired that person or this service had I known that was who I would be getting.  Now, she did not do a terrible job; she was perfectly adequate.  However, I recall the last time I paid for a professional writer about 10 years ago and I was wowed with what I got in return.  Resume Spice was merely adequate.  I had also used them (for an additional fee paid at sign up prior to getting my assigned writer) to re-do my LinkedIn profile, and it was similarly less than what I had expected.  So, overall, it was a passable, but unexceptional, job.  In hindsight, I would have gone with a different provider because this one lacked the same pop I had gotten years ago with a different service.",

I told her what I'd LIKE to spend and she said they couldn't do that. She still didn't send the quote for 25.

        "consumer_review": "I called regarding an issue with the usb ports on my computer suddenly not working. I panicked and instead of looking for solutions on youtube like I normally would, I tried calling this company which has good reviews.  I was offered tech support at a one-time rate of $69.99, and asked what would be paying for exactly.  I was told that the tech would help me solve my issue \"permanently\". This is the first time I've had an issue with my computer in the near 6 years I've owned it, and it was the result of a windows update which effected many people as far as I've read. The tech called me, his name was Robert, and he was very short and seemed irritated. He had me restart my computer and repeatedly press the F2 key on the keyboard to bring up the reset to factory settings prompt.  He told me to reset my computer which I did, and that he would call me back when it was completed.  There was no return phone call that day, and I went through the rest of the process of bringing my computer back up to speed on my own.  I wasn't contacted again until the next day while I was at work, and the representative seemed confused that I wasn't sitting in front of my computer still a day later.  Robert contacted me again an hour after this call and wanted to know when to call back. I work 10 plus hours a day so I couldn't give him a firm time when I'd be home and asked for a number to contact them so I could get this permanent fix to my issue. He was very rude and wanted to get off the phone as quickly as possible. He asked if they resolved my issue, which yeah the usb is working again, but they didn't do what they said they would do and fix anything permanently. He laughed and asked again if they resolved the issue.  I'm at work while this conversation is happening so it was very irritating to me. I would never call Support Nerds again. $69.99 to tell me to press F2 when I found a video on youtube which could have done the same thing for free.  There was no follow up, nor a permanent fix to the original issue. I was offered a free upgrade to windows 10, which is great because it's free anyways but no thanks. Try youtube first before you hand over your hard earned money to these rude people.",

Very good pricing (they kept their promise No Hidden Charges, what you see is what you pay) and a good aftersales experience. Could be better, like a banner saying that \"due to Christmas period orders might arrive a bit later\" or something similar. My package arrived later than expected because of that, but I cannot rate them one less star for this. I contacted them with email and their response time was amazing. Joseph and Derek were looking after my order the entire time and although I was worried about it, I never felt that they didn't care about the customer, which makes up for the old-fashioned website",

I wrote back and told Esther/Kristine that it was a bit more than I was able to spend, could she please send the quote for 25 units. Instead of sending me the quote, she asked me what my budget was. I told her what I'd LIKE to spend and she said they couldn't do that. She still didn't send the quote for 25. And the letter continued with reasons why they were more expensive, but the writing wasn't even correct English so I feel like the entire thing is suspect.",

I initially picked electronic save the dates for my wedding because I needed something to go out fast and not cost as much money. While the access to Facebook and emails was convenient, the pricing was not. For example, because the cost is set for a certain amount of people it counts each individual on a save the date, regardless if it's being sent to one family/couple. But if I had used paper save the dates, I would only have to pay for once to the family I was sending it to, not each individual. The organization of the guest list and the appearance of the card was nice, but if you're looking to save money - just use regular save the dates.",

Cons: Ordered  a name to be printed and the first name was not engraved. Its even included in the receipt. Because I like the way the cup looks, I can see past it. I still think it's badass! Make sure they engrave what you ask! Overall, I think this will be a great xmas gift. Thanks!Lauren",

Went I regave him the credentials he didn't have the game installed... so we had to wait like 3 hours.

One word of advice when shipping luxury goods internationally - make sure the vendor has an established partnership with a shipping vendor and is not someone who casually calculates delivery time like zChocolates does. You can take my advice or give your delivery one month variation to get the goods which in case of perishables you might not get the best product, or even worse you might ship a Valentine's day gift in March.I ordered chocolates for a family event, paid more than other competitors are charging on the promise my order will be there on time. With one week of time ahead of the event and paying extra for the delivery to get to the destination at the given date, I relied on zChocolates to be able to manage their logistics. They failed big time and not only have they missed their promissed delivery date by more than two days, they never assumed responsibility for their failure to manage their logistics. Every email I received from them blames everyone but their failure to manage their shipment and estimate their logistics.I can't tell you what their chocolates taste like because we have yet to receive them.",

This is hardly a big deal but we use the five places on a regular basis...  When traveling and we have 5 players.    Again, that may not be a problem for others.

I was very terrified that I might get scammed or hacked.  However, the friendly staff at Leprestore made me at ease and quickly helped me get over my fear of letting them use my account.  The only reason I gave them a 4/5 instead of 5/5 is because of the time responses took when I was talking to them via skype, it made me a bit skeptical. I now realize that they were just a very busy company with a lot of customers to take care of, but when they started the run, they were professional, fast, and reliable.  I would absolutely recommend these guys and use them again in the future.  This has been a review from a very real and very untrusting player.  And I would not say good things or recommend these guys if they didn't meet my high standards and expectations.  So take my word, these guys are worth your business! :)",

Information provided and contract were unclear, there is a difference between DIY package pricing and 'full service' package pricing. The price for DIY is steep considering you are using an app for 3 hours. With DIY you have to use your personal cell, personal data, no face to face contact with the company, 'prizes or medals' are not provided. So just something to think about. Next time we will use a free app. We did have fun exploring Louisville, meting locals, taking photos, and bonding.",

One word of advice when shipping luxury goods internationally - make sure the vendor has an established partnership with a shipping vendor and is not someone who casually calculates delivery time like zChocolates does. You can take my advice or give your delivery one month variation to get the goods which in case of perishables you might not get the best product, or even worse you might ship a Valentine's day gift in March.I ordered chocolates for a family event, paid more than other competitors are charging on the promise my order will be there on time. With one week of time ahead of the event and paying extra for the delivery to get to the destination at the given date, I relied on zChocolates to be able to manage their logistics. They failed big time and not only have they missed their promissed delivery date by more than two days, they never assumed responsibility for their failure to manage their logistics. Every email I received from them blames everyone but their failure to manage their shipment and estimate their logistics.I can't tell you what their chocolates taste like because we have yet to receive them.",

I have receipts of when I placed the order for three batteries and then a notice of a delivery problem. I went to my local Post Office to see if they could shed any light on why my order was not delivered and NADA. I have written emails but so far the best is POV will get back to me within 24 hrs. I've been a loyal customer and have made many transactions but right now THEY SUCK. I would like to order more but until this gets fixed no dice.",

        "consumer_review": "2nd Update 20 Sep 2020 - And I've Upgraded WLL to 2 Whole Stars! That's Full 1 Star Upgrade.So after the previous reviews, and back forth phone calls, and negotiating, and not having parts, but then the tech manager having parts and shipping them...the cheap plastic parts in an otherwise beautiful machine have been replaced - and the machine is back to performing flawlessly. Hence, WLL gets a second star for their third customer service response once the tech manager got involved (I'd give that guy 4-5 stars) but the overall company response and endorsement of a machine with reliability issues is still disappointing. My Recommendation:If you own this machine put in your request for extra cheap plastic parts that connect your reservoir to the boiler plumbing ASAP. And you don't need to know the names of the parts WLL is intimately familiar with this issue. I'd like to see them work a solution and recall with the manufacturer.Disclosures:I do not own an Italian espresso machine but I will in the future, and if anyone is interested in a used ECM Synkronicha, leave me a note ;)Update to previous review, previous post below with typos corrected!!!On 6 Sep 2019 WLL Customer Service Manager called my wife and spent a half hour discussing the issue and gave her the cell phone to the most experienced ECM technician at WLL...but they have yet to sync up schedules. This is an ok start in addressing the issue. There was some empathetic discourse at least, but interestingly, no offer to take the machine back and refund our money (money money money). My review that I submitted through WLL has yet to be posted to the website - though it is obvious that someone read it and responded. It is the same review as submitted below. Unfortunately, this is another knock against the current state of the company's reputation for me - \"The truth is out there\". Where is Fox Mulder when you need him to solve the mystery of disappearing negative reviews;)PREVIOUS REVIEWI'm the dummy that thought buying a German built espresso machine was a smart idea...I mean I did get away with buying two Spanish machines over the years from WLL that lasted respectively 8 years and 7 years and could still be refurbished but I wanted to upgrade...and WLL sucked me in with their full endorsement of the ECM Synchronica. For you dear reader, you don't need to be the next victim to fall for the WLL hype machine pushing an overpriced and unreliable machine. No dear reader, learn from my mistake, and this theme that continually runs through my head \"I wouldn't buy a car from Italy, what the hell was I thinking buying an espresso machine from Germany\".I'm such a dummy WLL love customer service likes to remind me of how big of a sucker I am every single time I call them with quippy responses like these below...WLL: \"Sir, it's past our thirty day return policy\"Me: \"I realize that, but it's leaking water and it's only 18 months old\"WLL: \"But it's a really high performing machine\"Me: \"It's not performing because it's turned off, otherwise it's leaking water all over my counter\"WLL: \"Did you take the machine apart and see where it is leaking from\"Me: \"No, I paid 3,000.00 dollars for a machine that is leaking water after 18 months of use, I want my money back, I don't want to learn to be an espresso machine repair person\"WLL: \"I can send you a video, so you can make sure you take it apart correctly\"Me: \"Fine\"Next CallMe: \"I took the machine apart and checked all the plastic parts you said could be leaking or cracked and they are not leaking or cracked\"WLL: \"It must be one of those parts, we can ship them to you\"Me: \"None of those parts are damaged or melted, or cracked\"WLL: \"Sir, we can ship you the parts but you have to pay shipping\"Me: \"Fine, ship me the parts but I think you should pay shipping\"WLL: \"Let me see if we can cover that\"Next call...WLL: \"Sir, we have decided not to pay for shipping\"Me: \"Fine, I'll pay for the shipping just ship me the parts\"WLL\"Ok, hold on......oh weird, we don't have any parts in stock, it's out of stock with no ETA\"Me: \"So...great, you'll ship these parts when they may come in, ok\"Don't be a dummy like me and buy this machine. And then let WLL customer service troll you like it's a comedy bit for SNL while your expensive espresso machine sits broken like an overpriced piece of German art. Now for WLL, since you know this is a problem and you keep pumping these machines out the door while they should be recalled you have no credibility left for me as a company. I want my money back!!!",

Once my mother was situated at the Elmcroft Ontario things went downhill quickly. Her care there was definitly not of the quality I had hoped for. She ended up in the hospital twice in one night. There was an issue with her medication that should have never happened and was found and fixed by the family. She is now back to her old self and home with daily caregiving. She is now afraid to go to assisted living because of the experience. I would not recommend the Elmcroft to anyone. Anthony Coleman is a most caring and responsive person.

I was offered a discount but I still thought it was silly that I had to pay for a subscription that was being used only for signing purposes. After writing this review, I was given a free subscription for my supervisor, which is greatly appreciated. If you are a resident or need your notes signed, be sure to contact TherapyNotes directly to inquire about pricing for your individual needs. TherapyNotes is also lacking in some basic features that would be nice, like a to do list that is not associated with appointments, a way to control who shows up on your active client list, and a session counter. Also, I once selected a setting to not automatically cancel appointments when a vacation is scheduled and now I can't find a way to change this. [Update: TherapyNotes's reply helped me address that]. Additionally, as a psychologist resident it would be awesome if there was a way to look at summaries of my scheduled hours doing various tasks. I also wish that they didn't require you to use the gender binary for patient information. Additionally, I find it annoying that if you start a note, but don't finish it, it shows up twice on your to do list. I've run into some difficulty with entering payments where if I don't do it just so, it will assign the person credits instead of taking it off the balance. This seems to happen when I enter the payment via the scheduled appointment box versus going into patient billing. Generally, I'd like to see more options for customization and to have them take things up a notch in terms of reducing glitches and improving features.",

        "consumer_review": "I contacted ZipHearing once I decided to try hearing aids to deal with my tinnitus. I spoke to Grant Davidson who assisted me in locating a authorized hearing aid business. Grant went above and beyond what I expected from ZipHearing! In challenges to overcome with what hearing aid would work best for me to even assisting me in answering questions regarding different types of hearing aids. I have had the hearing aids since October and now have a service issue. I moved out of state and didn't have access to my service provider so I called Grant. He located a new authorized Starkey dealer and even took care of the details for my repair. Five Stars, I would give six if I could. Thank you ZipHearing and Grant Davidson for not only saving me money but also for exemplary customer service.",

I asked for quotes on qty 25 and 100 for 2G and 4G drives. I got an email from \"Esther\" who also signed her name \"Kristine\", but it was only for 100 units. I wrote back and told Esther/Kristine that it was a bit more than I was able to spend, could she please send the quote for 25 units. Instead of sending me the quote, she asked me what my budget was. I told her what I'd LIKE to spend and she said they couldn't do that. She still didn't send the quote for 25. And the letter continued with reasons why they were more expensive, but the writing wasn't even correct English so I feel like the entire thing is suspect.",

I initially picked electronic save the dates for my wedding because I needed something to go out fast and not cost as much money. While the access to Facebook and emails was convenient, the pricing was not. For example, because the cost is set for a certain amount of people it counts each individual on a save the date, regardless if it's being sent to one family/couple. But if I had used paper save the dates, I would only have to pay for once to the family I was sending it to, not each individual. The organization of the guest list and the appearance of the card was nice, but if you're looking to save money - just use regular save the dates.",

        "consumer_review": "I ordered four oil paintings by four different artists of different photos of my recently passed dog, each one representing a different feature; three were ordered together and the fourth one a couple weeks later - before the first ones were done enough for online review. After a couple of online reviews and revisions, the paintings were approved and the remaining cost paid. When the three arrived, one was okay, one had a piece of light hard material stuck in the middle of the painting in my dog's black back, and the third, and largest painting (36\"x24\") had only a little paint on the sides of the 1.5\" gallery wrap rather than the full painted edges. I notified their customer service and after the attendant discussed it with a manager offline I was told that they would refund me $100 or give me 20% off my next painting. This was unacceptable. We finally agreed that I would try and remove the foreign material from the one painting and I would destroy the large painting and they would have it repainted in full. It was difficult to tear the painting of my dog apart but they needed photographic proof before they started. Now after three revisions on the eyes the fourth painting arrived; it had the same problem with the unpainted edges on the 1.5\" gallery wrap. I informed customer assistance and the company wanted to do the same destroy and repaint. I said I'd wait and see how the currently finishing up repainting came out. I received the repainting today; the edges of the wrap are painted and the painting is excellent. Only two problems: the canvas isn't properly stretched so there is a warp in the picture, and the painting was obviously rushed in packaging-it was still tacky when it arrived via FedEx and the painting was not well protected on the makeshift box it was sent in. Thus all the edges and especially the corners have the paint worn off. I'll have to cut my dog's painting up again, but I'm going to demand my money back on these two paintings. Good artists, bad quality control afterwards.",

One word of advice when shipping luxury goods internationally - make sure the vendor has an established partnership with a shipping vendor and is not someone who casually calculates delivery time like zChocolates does. You can take my advice or give your delivery one month variation to get the goods which in case of perishables you might not get the best product, or even worse you might ship a Valentine's day gift in March.I ordered chocolates for a family event, paid more than other competitors are charging on the promise my order will be there on time. With one week of time ahead of the event and paying extra for the delivery to get to the destination at the given date, I relied on zChocolates to be able to manage their logistics. They failed big time and not only have they missed their promissed delivery date by more than two days, they never assumed responsibility for their failure to manage their logistics. Every email I received from them blames everyone but their failure to manage their shipment and estimate their logistics.I can't tell you what their chocolates taste like because we have yet to receive them.",

        "consumer_review": "I ordered four oil paintings by four different artists of different photos of my recently passed dog, each one representing a different feature; three were ordered together and the fourth one a couple weeks later - before the first ones were done enough for online review. After a couple of online reviews and revisions, the paintings were approved and the remaining cost paid. When the three arrived, one was okay, one had a piece of light hard material stuck in the middle of the painting in my dog's black back, and the third, and largest painting (36\"x24\") had only a little paint on the sides of the 1.5\" gallery wrap rather than the full painted edges. I notified their customer service and after the attendant discussed it with a manager offline I was told that they would refund me $100 or give me 20% off my next painting. This was unacceptable. We finally agreed that I would try and remove the foreign material from the one painting and I would destroy the large painting and they would have it repainted in full. It was difficult to tear the painting of my dog apart but they needed photographic proof before they started. Now after three revisions on the eyes the fourth painting arrived; it had the same problem with the unpainted edges on the 1.5\" gallery wrap. I informed customer assistance and the company wanted to do the same destroy and repaint. I said I'd wait and see how the currently finishing up repainting came out. I received the repainting today; the edges of the wrap are painted and the painting is excellent. Only two problems: the canvas isn't properly stretched so there is a warp in the picture, and the painting was obviously rushed in packaging-it was still tacky when it arrived via FedEx and the painting was not well protected on the makeshift box it was sent in. Thus all the edges and especially the corners have the paint worn off. I'll have to cut my dog's painting up again, but I'm going to demand my money back on these two paintings. Good artists, bad quality control afterwards.",

        "consumer_review": "I ordered four oil paintings by four different artists of different photos of my recently passed dog, each one representing a different feature; three were ordered together and the fourth one a couple weeks later - before the first ones were done enough for online review. After a couple of online reviews and revisions, the paintings were approved and the remaining cost paid. When the three arrived, one was okay, one had a piece of light hard material stuck in the middle of the painting in my dog's black back, and the third, and largest painting (36\"x24\") had only a little paint on the sides of the 1.5\" gallery wrap rather than the full painted edges. I notified their customer service and after the attendant discussed it with a manager offline I was told that they would refund me $100 or give me 20% off my next painting. This was unacceptable. We finally agreed that I would try and remove the foreign material from the one painting and I would destroy the large painting and they would have it repainted in full. It was difficult to tear the painting of my dog apart but they needed photographic proof before they started. Now after three revisions on the eyes the fourth painting arrived; it had the same problem with the unpainted edges on the 1.5\" gallery wrap. I informed customer assistance and the company wanted to do the same destroy and repaint. I said I'd wait and see how the currently finishing up repainting came out. I received the repainting today; the edges of the wrap are painted and the painting is excellent. Only two problems: the canvas isn't properly stretched so there is a warp in the picture, and the painting was obviously rushed in packaging-it was still tacky when it arrived via FedEx and the painting was not well protected on the makeshift box it was sent in. Thus all the edges and especially the corners have the paint worn off. I'll have to cut my dog's painting up again, but I'm going to demand my money back on these two paintings. Good artists, bad quality control afterwards.",

That part did take an extra week but quality was at the top of my list so I did not mind.  I was hoping my shipment would arrive by Thanksgiving and it did with two days to spare.  The quality of my photography shines through with the quality of the printing.  The problems my order incurred were during packaging and shipping where each of the two pallets broke along the way resulting in 2 of the 1000 books being destroyed by a forklift operator (stronger pallets would be better).  Also, I ordered a wrap around glossy photo for my cover and 50% of the books incurred a mark (probably from a conveyer) in the form of a line that runs across either the front or back of the covers and it is permanent.  This happened some time before or while the finished books were packaged.  This lowers the quality of half of my books before they are ever opened.  I'm still hoping PrintNinja will compensate me for this issue.",

So I can't not speak with any accuracy on how well Trustpilot does on matching people with positions. But I gave it a 3 star rating because I do trust the American Military News. If the AMN says it's good, and if I were looking for placement the AMN would be where I would start. Sorry I couldn't be of more help.",

        "consumer_review": "I had taken a $2500 online program (by a VERY well known business guru) designed to help me go from zero to launching an online business. It was a very helpful course.But...I found that while I was able to create initial validation for the idea and actually did launch, it takes a TON of work to get \"passive income\". Writing all the content, sending out emails, etc. Not to mention, you don't actually make a ton of money when you sell programs for a few hundred bucks. And, of the people that bought my course, NOBODY took action. So I couldn't get testimonials (which meant I felt like I wasn't really doing anything important, couldn't show that my course was working, couldn't get referrals etc). Upon checking in on the rockstar students in that program, almost all used coaching as their primary source of income.My ONE client that I had that actually took action (after much pestering) recommended COD. I am SO GLAD she did. I made back the COD investment after a few weeks in the program, my clients are now getting results and they are SO THANKFUL, and I've got testimonials and a funnel to help me grow.You should 100% take COD if you're serious about your client's results. The group model works so much better than 1-1 coaching (I used to have lots of people reschedule calls, and they got far worse results with 1-1), and so much better than self-study courses (which basically nobody takes action on).I also love the COD facebook grads group -- it's so encouraging to see other people winning with the program. I have no doubt that this has kept me going (after all, learning to sell a $5k program over the phone isn't easy).That said, I also took SOD. While it got me an ROI and I highly recommend the program, I feel like SOD could be improved to get better student results. Marc is excellent at sales, but I don't think he's a great teacher of how to get other people (that don't have the same offer as he's selling) to get better in a reliable way. I would have loved a similar staged approach as is in COD (where you submit facebook copy, mission statement, webinar outine, all for feedback along the way). But instead, it's just one review of your script, and one review of one call. With how complex sales is, I don't think this is enough feedback to ensure students actually internalize the lessons fully. I'd recommend potentially hiring a retired teacher or something to consult on the learning model, because it would be amazing to have sales drills or something to isolate the individual skills and actually test them along the way somehow (think of learning basketball -- getting one feedback session with Michael Jordan is great, but interactive practice sessions with an OK coach is even better, or drills you can practice at home to isolate individual skills). So, should you take COD? Yes. No doubt. Could COD get better? Maybe a tiny bit, but I already think it's probably 95% of the way to a foolproof method. It's not a get-rich-quick scheme, but it's by far the best program I've ever taken, and it'll get you a quick ROI if you do the work.Should you take SOD? Yes. Could it get better? MUCH BETTER. I think the potential here to teach more effectively (and check in with students at a few points along the way as COD does) would be phenomenal, and would make the program easily worth 10 times as much to me. I think the results one gets with SOD are much more variable and much more left to the individual students to figure out, and I know there's so much knowledge in Marc's head.",

Also, you need to drop everything in your life and just do this program because if you don't get through the materials in the given amount of time, that's it, you're done. You're moved over to the graduated group. This happened to me and I was not able to get the help to get my webinar selling. Basically I spent a ton of money to create a FB group. I was really not an ideal candidate for this program and wish I had been vetted better. It does work for some, but not for me. Yes, I did seek help in the graduate group and found someone who wanted 5k to help me. It really didn't provide the support I needed to be successful.",

        "consumer_review": "I used the online tutoring service offered by Varsity Tutors for MCAT Prep. During the course of about 2.5 months, I went through 4 tutors. Based off my experience, I believe Varsity Tutors should have a different screening process for their tutors. According to my account manager, the main criteria for their tutors included achieving a high MCAT score and possibly being accepted into a prestigious medical school. However, it is my understanding that ability to teach was not taken into account during the hiring process.       My first tutor seemed knowledgable, but very distracted. I was not convinced he was invested in my learning process. When we would have sessions, he would often be talking to people in the background, excusing himself multiple times, and ending our sessions early.       My second tutor was highly knowledgable and accomplished. However, he seemed overloaded with his residency program and tutoring responsibilities. He would often not respond to my messages and scheduling new sessions was very difficult. Ultimately, I felt he was not able to invest in me the appropriate amount of time.      My third tutor did not convince me that he was sufficiently knowledgable about the material. He seemed disorganized and uninterested. There was an instance where I was having a hard time during a practice test and was feeling overwhelmed. After telling him this, he told me to consider pulling my med. school app and taking the test the following cycle. While I believe he was trying to be realistic with me, he did not ask, \"What is it that you're struggling with? Let's go over it\". Instead, he made a rash suggestion without first investigating the situation. This is an attribute I don't think is appropriate for a tutor, much less a physician.       My last tutor was EXCELLENT. She was prompt, communicative, organized, and highly invested in my experience. She offered me SO much advice regarding the medical school application process and I ended up also seeking her help in writing my Personal Statement. She is the reason I give this company one of the stars. She was extremely knowledgable and methodical in her approach, she knew how to teach, and she was an overall excellent tutor.      Varsity Tutors ended up giving us a partial refund, which is the reason I awarded a second star. Ultimately, I believe this company has potential, but needs to look at their screening process for tutors. If they are going to charge high rates for tutoring services, the tutors should be excellent.",

        "consumer_review": "I opened a \"ProFinder\" professional services request via LinkedIn and Resume Spice was one of the respondents.  The person I was contacted by was eloquent and had a fantastic back ground (Harvard MBA, been offering resume consulting services for 2 years, headhunter for 5 years).  I was intrigued so had the consult (where I would get to interview the service).  However, the person I interviewed was not the person who contacted me about the service.  Strange, but she was well spoken, had some great ideas and feedback about my existing resume, so I signed up.  When it came time for someone to write my resume, it was yet another person (so, not the person with the impressive background that approached me, and not the person I interviewed).  The person who ended up providing the service had only been with the firm for less than two months; I would not have hired that person or this service had I known that was who I would be getting.  Now, she did not do a terrible job; she was perfectly adequate.  However, I recall the last time I paid for a professional writer about 10 years ago and I was wowed with what I got in return.  Resume Spice was merely adequate.  I had also used them (for an additional fee paid at sign up prior to getting my assigned writer) to re-do my LinkedIn profile, and it was similarly less than what I had expected.  So, overall, it was a passable, but unexceptional, job.  In hindsight, I would have gone with a different provider because this one lacked the same pop I had gotten years ago with a different service.",

I was told they received the product prefrozen  and they have no way of knowing if they are soft shells or paper shells.VERY  DISAPPOINTED!!",

The company was always willing to make things right with us no matter how subtle the issue was.Today the company has grown and become much more streamlined than it used to be. The website is well organized and easy to use though the pricing changes very quickly when make changes or substitutions so be aware of what you are doing. The company ships via FEDEX and so far we have never lost refrigeration on any of our orders. If you order exactly 21 items your order will fit in 1 box which will be sent without charges or fees. The food is well prepared. Most of the meals re-heat well. However certain meals SHOULD NOT be microwaved no matter what the instructions say. The chefs at TCM are adept at using a multitude of seasonings and flavors to accommodate those who have eating issues like allergies or Low Sodium requirements.",

I called the customer service number provided and spoke with a representative that stated I should contact my local post office so that they could assist me with locating my package. I tracked my package again while on the phone with the representative and discovered they package was at my local post office and out for delivery. I explained to the representative that the package would arrive with enough time for me to use it as a gift as I intended to however I would like a refund for the shipping because it was garunteed to be delivered several days ago and that's when she became rude. I did receive my refund for the shipping I don't think I was wrong for asking for it and didn't appreciate the rude response.",

        "consumer_review": "I buy diamonds for over 25 years (just by passion), and saw a lot of diamonds that were branded \"ideal\" with AGS and sometimes GIA reports, from several sellers. But I don't think they are all equal. By the end of the day, I always come back to Brian Gavin. I've owned several BG Signature diamonds (and still own one that I don't want to upgrade), and I'm now the proud owner of a \"Black\" diamond. \"Black\" is the new level of H&A diamonds. In my opinion, these diamonds perform incredibly well in all lighting conditions, even the most diffuse lighting. Because the ASET shows no green in the table (and because of the crisp optical symmetry), the flashes of color are very broad, and this makes the diamond look bigger. I have the feeling that the light return and fire coming from the crown also participate to make these diamonds look more spready than an usual AGS-0 diamond. Some years ago, you could find diamond with a painted girdle. This \"painting\" had both positive and negative effects. With \"Black\" by Brian Gavin, you have the positive effects without the negative; the \"Black\" diamonds are not painted, they are just fine tuned. And they are checked for color, clarity and transparency. Now the question is: would I still buy a \"Signature\"? Yes, I would. Like I said above, I still own one Signature that I will never sell. My ring was a very specific request, and it came out even better than what I wanted.Thank you for this exquisite experience!",

BGD agreed to attempt to set it in a bezel necklace and also make me a new engagement ring. I picked a BGD Blue and the gorgeous Lola setting. We had a few dramas with customs when the old setting was shipped home but it was worth it for the end product. Jamie was right - my BGD Blue diamond is crystal clear and quite simply, is a beautiful stone. We had a small communication issue - my old princess centre stone was square set rather than kite set as requested.

When talking on the phone with them prior to sending the ring in it felt rushed, and I don't think they really listened to my questions. I would start to ask a question and they would start to answer before I was finished. So onto the actual repair portion. I sent the ring in waited two weeks with no response from them. I Called in asking how the repair was going. Apparently there was some confusion about me having wedding bands soldered to the ring. Not sure what stopped them from contacting me or when they were actually going to do that. I also don't see how that hindered their repair in anyway. I asked if they would be adding onto the claws as I thought they looked worn down. The person on the phone never heard of such a thing. So I pay the bill and receive the ring with now looks phenomenal again! Although they have clearly added onto the claws so I'm not sure why the person on the phone thought that was nonsense. In the end the ring looks fantastic so the workmanship is excellent, I just wished whoever is on the phone had the same attention to detail.",

We would like to have you send those Glendales back to us as that is not an acceptable tolerance for quality control to have passed. Although, we are all out of stock in the Glendales until the end of April when we are expecting the shipment of the re-stocks to come in. So, please hold onto yours until then and once they are re-stocked we can handle this with a new replacement. If you have any questions or concerns, please let me know. Thank you,Sierra\"",

        "consumer_review": "The 'Grace' is a wonderful traditional boat although a bit noisy and rocky on rough seas, but we loved it; we had a very nice spacious room; the staff, food and our guide (Raffa) were excellent. The daily activities were well organized; however, if you don't like swimming, diving or at least snorkeling twice daily, what do you do? Sit on the boat! The excursions on the various islands are lovely, but way too brief; one has no time whatsoever to walk along the lovely trails for a couple of hours to observe and enjoy the diverse landscapes and/or wildlife. We saw some great sea life, some rare creatures and birds close-up and liked seeing the islands, but I would not say that it was \"a trip of a lifetime\". We subsequently spent 2 weeks traveling on main land Ecuador by car which was fabulous, the roads are good, well sign-posted and driving is easy. Guayaquil (the Hotel del Parque is wonderful but way off the beaten track), Cajas National Park, and especially the colonial centers of the towns of Cuenca (the Hotel Mansion de Alcazar is lovely and has a good restaurant) and Quito are well worth spending time in; the Gangotena Hotel in Quito has a great location on the Plaza San Francisco and is good for exploring the historic center of town, but the restaurant is mediocre, and there are no good restaurants in the area (they are in the modern part of the city quite a long way away); we only liked the breakfast buffet. Driving north from Quito to visit various lagunas and haciendas is a wonderful experience. We stayed for 4 full days at the Hacienda Zuleta which is a spectacular place, however, it is way overpriced in our opinion and there is relatively little to do: horseback riding which is great and hiking which is arduous and treacherous on the longer trails. Overall it was a great trip; traveling on the mainland contributed considerably to our very positive travel experience in Ecuador and we would certainly go back to explore more of the mainland.",

While I don't have the experience of doing an online application on my own to compare with, having somebody with real expertise to advise and help took a huge load off my mind. I sent my passport to Zana on 17 January and got the new one on 3 February, and I live in a really remote part of upstate New York, so the turn-around time was quite amazing. Zana was very professional and totally on top of every detail. He responded quickly to all my queries. I really recommend his services.",

Would have liked more info on difficulty of trek, went from sea level to 15,500 feet in a very short time. Needed another day in Cusco to adjust to altitude and one needs to be in well above average physical condition to enjoy the trek. Dolfin 1 was an a fantastic ship with every thing 5 star along with an amazing chef bringing us the best cuisine imaginable. Disappointed not to get to do the tree top walk. Not told until the day of the planned walk. Saw a lot of exotic birds, few mammals. Overall a very enjoyable trip.",

Despite the unnecessary delay created, the email requests were ignored. The ticket protection ticket was paid but I couldn't get any support from them. Thus, I called the airlines if they can assist in changing the date but they said the Agency has locked it and they can't assist me at all. I don't suggest this company if you have doubt about changing the dates of your trip as they have terrible service of customer service - particularly post-purchase of the ticket.",

They misled my father into booking a flight with a travel protection plan that would supposedly guarantee a 100% refund for cancellations or re-booking without fees. Needless to say those promises are false and they have likely scammed many others. This is false advertising and frankly bad business! I\u2019m extremely disappointed and I\u2019ve reported them to the BBB. Please do not do business with ASAP tickets, ITN (international travel network) Corp, LLC or their affiliates!

The first two times I thought it was me but this is the same stroller I have at home and it seemed to get worse as the trip went on. I could not collapse the stroller quickly, the pulls were not triggering what they needed to and I would have to push one side back and start over a few times until I got it.

There was a LOT of time in the car, so if you want a \"walkable\" location, be sure to check out prior to booking.  We went to Manuel Antonio and La Fortuna, and neither place was either safe or practical to walk...other than on the hotel grounds. Drivers were mandatory for both places (you could try to walk off property in Manuel Antonio, but the road had no place for pedestrians, and it was extremely dangerous).  Also, you will end up spending a LOT more money than they charge you, as they only book a few things for you to do...and the rest is up to you.  These people definitely made a fortune on booking my travel to Costa Rica...as I checked on the hotel rates, tour prices, etc.  I would NOT use them again.",

He was with us the entire time until we had to cross the border into Jordan. The transfer from the Egyptian bus to the Jordanian bus and having to go through two different customs and security took hours and we were all kind of left wondering what was happening next in between borders. With no detailed explanation from the guide on what to expect. Waiting in the heat was especially difficult. Avi was our guide on the Israel\u2019s side and he was super knowledgeable but not as engaging as Anis. He was masterful in getting us first in line for outings like the Jordan River to beat the crowds. But it felt a bit rushed overall. He should hold up a bright flag so we can easily follow him. It\u2019s hard especially for the elderly to catch up with him. The fellow travelers were all talking about how much more rigorous the hikes and walks were than we all expected. Especially in the rugged terrain that I worried about the elderly making it. I would definitely wear not just comfy shoes but hiking shoes and sandals. Bringing a UV umbrella was a godsend. What a difference it made. The food was not that great and mundane after awhile. The accommodations in each location was hit or miss. But overall it was a great spiritual adventure.",

One was transfers from airport to first hotel, waited over two hours in airport and pilgrim person was found after 30 minutes in seeking them and waited an hour in first hotel for rooms. Transfer from last hotel did not arrive, Jennifer of Pilgrim arranged another transfer after waiting half of hour.Second problem was the last day of tour we were put together with a group that it was their first day so left hotel an hour late for their members plus we repeated sites that we had already done since their group had not SO PAID twice to revisit sites again.  Best part was Jennifer and guide Avi.  Fourth time in using three different companies, Pilgrim twice.  Think twice selecting Pilgrim in future.",

Little effort seemed to have been made by Exito and SouthAmerica.travel towards planning and making arrangements for our trip.If, despite the above you choose to use these groups, VERIFY all issues.Details and prices of elements are essential prior to submitting any payments.Dot all \u2018i\u2019s and cross all \u2018t\u2019s\u2019 with proper skepticism and scrutiny.",

After the first section (about 3 hours\u2019 time) the course said I was 10% through, so I was super excited that things were going smoothly (keep in mind the course says it takes 30 hours to complete). However, after working through the next sections for the same amount of time and only completing another 3-5% of the course, I was becoming suspicious. My suspicions were confirmed that this course takes more than 30 hours over the next 20-ish sections; in fact, when I finished the course, my time totaled to over 50 hours - and that is with me advancing as fast as I can on each slide. So, if you are willing to give more of your time to learning the laws of the road, then this is a great course for you. But, if you were just looking to complete the assigned number of hours by Joshua\u2019s Law (30 hours), then I recommend you send your business elsewhere.",

Still reasonable pricing but that's not cool. Why is the price not the price?  We'll see if the first impression is lasting.EDIT: Forevercar reached out to explain that the quote changed while I was checking out because of a price increase. While I think they should have honored the earlier quote, or at least made it clear on the site that prices went up and the effective date, I appreciated the explanation.",

My dealer refused to work with them due to the time involved in trying to get claims processed. Additionally, I didn't find this out until I had already had the coverage for 6 months and spent $450. That money was refused to be refunded to me on the grounds that they didn't break the contract in their eyes. When asked for a list of providers local to me they gave me one. The one they provided wasn't an acceptable option for me. Bottom line is that if you don't verify first that your mechanic will honor this warranty you can expect to go through a hassle at a minimum, and lose money in the process. I will add that I checked with both local Jeep dealers, as well as an independent mechanic that a friend of mine uses and not only did they say they wouldn't work with this insurance but they gave the reason that it's too much a hassle to get claims processed through this carrier.",

I hate it..... waaay to may problems that are considered acceptable. Like having to put in a power disconnect switch so the system doesn't scramble my radio/computer and set a CEL....... really?
